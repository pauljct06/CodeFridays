su = super
pl = plat
go = gold
si = silver

k = 10

I use a priority queue for this algorithm
pQ -> []

 * insert si4

pQ -> [si4]

 * insert si9

pQ -> [si9, si4]

...
after multiple insertions

pQ -> [su8, su8, su4, pl6, go4, si9, si6, si4, si3, si2]

 * insert an 11th element (go5) when k = 10 is full


 pQ -> [su8, su8, su4, pl6, ,go5 go4, si9, si6, si4, si3]
 // I moved the last item in the pQ and placed it in a new pQ for removed frequent fliers

 pQremoved -> [si2]

 * frequent flier su4 cancels upgrade

 pQ -> [su8, su8, pl6, ,go5 go4, si9, si6, si4, si3, si2]
 // removed frequent flier, shifted queue and added back si2 from PQremoved into pQ
